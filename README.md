# RimTraits - Rimworld Of Magic patch

This mod changes the colors of traits from A Rimworld Of Magic (AROM) classes the same as RimTraits does for vanilla traits.

It also changes the displayed trait name for the Ravenous class from from Kure's additional AROM classes mod to "Ravenous Horror" so that it's possible to differentiate from the non-magical Ravenous trait that added by other mods.

Colors can be customized by editing this patch's .xml files to use different hex color values.

### Compatibility

- [Minor Conflict] Conflicts with mods that change trait color based on commonality.
